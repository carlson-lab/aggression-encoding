def load_data(filename, fBounds=(1,56), feature_list=['ESR1_power_all', 'ESR1_coherence_all','ESR1_granger_all']):
    """ Loads and extracts data from a JSON file with preprocessed data.
    
    Loads the data from the file, then extracts each field, takes only the data
    within the frequency bounds specified by the input fBounds, and transforms each
    data matrix to be a 2-dimensional matrix where axis 0 is the time window and axis 1
    iterates first by brain area and then by frequency.
    
    INPUTS
    filename: name of the .mat (and .json) file containing the data
        and labels variables. The .mat file should be gzipped, but
        filename should not include .gz. The .json file is not
        gzipped. The .mat file is a list of 3 fields in the order
        power, coherence, granger, and the .json file contains labels.
        LOADED VARIABLES
        power: MxNxP matrix containing the power data for the file,
            where M is frequency, N is brain region, and P is windows.
        coherence: MxNxPxQ matrix containing coherency data for the file,
            where M is frequency, N is window, and P and Q are both
            brain regions.
        labels: Structure containing labeling information for the data. 
            FIELDS:
            'f': dictionary with (k,f) where k is index and f is frequency value.
            'windows': Structure containing information on windows.
                FIELDS:
                'task': Task being done.
                'mouse': Name of mouse.
                'powerFeatures': MxN matrix of string labels describing the
                    features represented in labels.power. M is frequency, N is
                    brain area.
                'cohFeatures': MxPxQ array of string labels describing the
                    features represented in labels.coherence. M is frequency, P
                    and Q are the two brain areas where coherence is calculated.
                'gcFeatures': PxF array of string labels describing the
                    features represented in labels.granger. P iterates over
                    directed pairs of regions, F iterates over frequencies.

    feature_list: list of strings indicating which variables to load from the .mat file
    fBounds: frequency bounds to analyze; default is set to between 1 and 120 Hz, inclusive.
    
    OUTPUTS
    power: Transformed matrix of power values within the frequency range given by fBounds
        in the form MxN, where M is time windows and N is a combination of brain area and
        frequency, iterating first frequency then by area.
    coherence: Transformed matrix of coherency values within the frequency range given by
        fBounds; same dimensions as power. In this case, brain area refers to the pair of brain
        areas being compared.
    granger: Transformed matrix of granger causality values within the frequency range given by
        fBounds; same dimensions as power. In this case, brain area refers to the pair of brain
        areas being compared.
    labels: See labels field of filename above.
